How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?


     As a program writer I need to know what the user wants to do and what goal that acheives for them.  I need
     to get there input and give them their expected results.  "User stories" do just this; they come in the
     format what user <type> … wants to <perform some task>… so that they can < achieve some goal> which lends
     to the development of acceptance criteria that is easy to code and implement a program from.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

    Some of these last programs have seemed to be developing forms and page layout, which I am not super familiar
    with. I was seeing that if the actual travel software was running there would have been a lot of database
    queries on the vacation set information.  The agile process I took away the most was that small deviations that
    are easy to make with a little creativity can be fun.  Sort of trying to roll with the punches attitude, and put
    a decent effort into it.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

    Do your part because others are depending on you. Be transparent when you are facing obstacles.
